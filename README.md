# An ESP32 Memory Game
As a fun little day project, I decided to make a game where a player needs to memorise a random sequence and correctly input it into the system like BOB IT.

When looking on my electronics shelf, I found four LEDs: yellow, red, blue, green. I found an ESP32 which I had been meaning to use anyway, some wires and resistors. I knew what I was going to make... but I realised that I didn't have enough pushbuttons. They either got lost somewhere or I gave them away. I wasn't too sure what to do until a joystick caught my eye. These things seemed cool but never really used, so I decided I'd learn how to use the module.

So... what's the game?

The computer will show the player a sequence starting with only one step. If the player correctly replicates the step using the joystick, then another step is added onto the sequence. 

Pretty simple right?

Yeah, for the most part...
